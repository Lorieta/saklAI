# Quantitative Metrics Documentation for SaklAI Evaluation System

## Overview

The SaklAI evaluation system now includes comprehensive quantitative metrics that provide precise numerical measurements across multiple dimensions of system performance. These metrics enable data-driven decision making and objective assessment of the RAG and translation systems.

## Categories of Quantitative Metrics

### 1. Response Quality Metrics

#### BLEU Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- **Purpose**: Measures translation and text generation quality
- **Calculation**: N-gram precision (1-4 grams) with brevity penalty
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0.7+ = Excellent quality
  - 0.5-0.7 = Good quality
  - 0.3-0.5 = Fair quality
  - <0.3 = Poor quality

#### ROUGE Scores (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

- **ROUGE-1**: Unigram overlap between reference and candidate
- **ROUGE-2**: Bigram overlap
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest Common Subsequence overlap
- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- **Purpose**: Evaluate summarization and text generation
- **Higher scores indicate better content overlap**

#### Semantic Similarity

- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- **Method**: Sentence embeddings with cosine similarity
- **Purpose**: Measures meaning preservation regardless of exact wording
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0.8+ = High semantic preservation
  - 0.6-0.8 = Moderate preservation
  - <0.6 = Low preservation

#### Lexical Diversity (Type-Token Ratio)

- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- **Calculation**: Unique words / Total words
- **Purpose**: Measures vocabulary richness and fluency
- **Higher values indicate more diverse vocabulary**

### 2. Performance Metrics

#### Response Time Distribution

- **Average Response Time**: Mean processing time
- **Median Response Time**: 50th percentile (less affected by outliers)
- **95th Percentile**: Performance under normal load
- **99th Percentile**: Performance under stress
- **Standard Deviation**: Consistency measure

#### Throughput and Reliability

- **Operations Per Second (QPS)**: System capacity
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **System Reliability**: Overall success rate

### 3. Accuracy Metrics

#### Exact Match Accuracy

- **Definition**: Percentage of perfect matches
- **Use Case**: Strict correctness evaluation
- **Range**: 0% - 100%

#### Classification Metrics

- **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0 for each metric

### 4. RAG-Specific Metrics

#### Retrieval Quality

- **Precision@K**: Relevant documents in top-K results
- **Recall@K**: Retrieved relevant documents vs. total relevant
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Ranking quality measure
- **Context Relevance**: How well retrieved context matches query

#### Answer Quality

- **Answer Faithfulness**: Response accuracy to context
- **Context Utilization**: How well the system uses retrieved information

### 5. Translation-Specific Metrics

#### Error Rates

- **Character Error Rate (CER)**: Character-level accuracy
- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Word-level accuracy
- **Lower values indicate better translation quality**

#### Translation Quality

- **Adequacy**: Semantic similarity to reference
- **Fluency**: Natural language quality (lexical diversity)

### 6. Statistical Metrics

#### Confidence Intervals

- **95% Confidence Interval**: Statistical reliability bounds
- **Purpose**: Indicates measurement certainty
- **Interpretation**: Narrower intervals = more reliable results

#### Distribution Analysis

- **Variance**: Spread of response times
- **Standard Deviation**: Consistency measure
- **Skewness**: Distribution symmetry (future enhancement)

### 7. Business Impact Metrics

#### User Experience Proxies

- **Task Completion Rate**: End-to-end success rate
- **User Satisfaction Proxy**: Combined quality score
- **System Reliability**: Overall dependability measure

## Metric Interpretation Guidelines

### Quality Thresholds

```
Excellent:  BLEU > 0.7, Semantic Sim > 0.8, F1 > 0.9
Good:       BLEU > 0.5, Semantic Sim > 0.6, F1 > 0.8
Acceptable: BLEU > 0.3, Semantic Sim > 0.4, F1 > 0.7
Poor:       Below acceptable thresholds
```

### Performance Thresholds

```
Excellent:    < 1.0s average response time
Good:         < 3.0s average response time
Acceptable:   < 5.0s average response time
Needs Work:   > 5.0s average response time
```

### Reliability Thresholds

```
Production Ready:  > 99% reliability
Near Production:   > 95% reliability
Development:       > 90% reliability
Early Stage:       < 90% reliability
```
